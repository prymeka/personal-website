A sample blog made using [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/), which is an extremely fast framework for building static sites written in Golang - it is perfect for blogs and documentations. Additionally, for CSS I have used [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) framework. The blog is done entirly in HTML/CSS save for a few small touches where JavaScript was required.
