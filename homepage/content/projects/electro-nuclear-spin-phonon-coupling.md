A study of the electro-nuclear spin-phonon coupling and relaxation in molecular qubits. Developed a machine learning model capable of predicting the spin and spin-phonon Hamiltonians from the first principle.

Project developed as part of the [Trinity College Dublin Hamilton Summer Internship](https://www.maths.tcd.ie/alumni/hamilton-scholars/internship/) 2021.
