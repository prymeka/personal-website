Recent developments in technology allow us to control matter on the nano-scales. This enabled the creation and study of electronic quantum systems (EQS). Artificial atomic lattices allow for more precise and complex systems to be realised in experiments, which includes non-integer/fractal systems. In this project, I have computationally modelled and analysed the electronic properties of a system with the geometry of three variations of the Sierpinski triangle fractal using Python.

Project developed as part of the [Trinity College Dublin Hamilton Summer Internship](https://www.maths.tcd.ie/alumni/hamilton-scholars/internship/) 2020.
