Most computer simulations in the area of foams have been performed in the dry limit. Wet foams, on the other hand, do not receive as much attention; nonetheless, their significance cannot be overstated. In this project, wet foams in 3D are simulated using the Morse-Witten model as well as the more approximate Durian model. The software was developed to equilibrate foam structures in confinement. High-quality, realistic images of deformed bubbles described by the Morse-Witten theory were then realised using the 3D graphics software Blender in order to better understand the nature of the bubble-bubble interaction.

Dissertation required for completion of B.A. degree in Theoretical Physics at Trinity College Dublin.
