I'm an **AI Engineer** who is also passionate about Web Development and everything else computer-related. I have a B.A. in **Theoretical Physics** from [Trinity College Dublin](https://www.tcd.ie/) and a M.Sc. in **Artificial Intelligence** from [University of Limerick](https://www.ul.ie/). 

I have long experience working with `Python` and a bit shorter one with `JavaScript` and `HTML`/`CSS`. I'm also familiar with technologies such as `C`/`C++`, `Linux`, `Bash`, `AWS`.
